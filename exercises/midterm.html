      <h2>Used Book Sale</h2>
      <p>
        We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and
        more at our monthly sale! These are mostly from donations as well as items
        that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for
        new material.

        On Saturdays, we hand out numbered tickets per person in line for the Main Room, beginning
        at 8 am. The number on the ticket reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing
        you to visit the Chilren's and Bargain Book rooms. Be sure to return to the Main Room
        a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot: if you miss when your number is allowed
        to enter the Main Room you will forfeit your place in line.
      </p>

      <h3>Main Room</h3>
      <p>
        Our Main Room is located along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston
        Shopping Center. Hardbound book start at $1 each and paperback books at 50 cents
        each. You can also purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.<br>
        <em>Please bring your large book donations to this room.</em>

      <h3>Children's Room</h3>
      <p>
        Our Children's Room is new and located near the Cubberley track, Pavillion, and
        the Greendell School. Our Children's Room opens one hours earlier than the main
        room on Saturday. Here you can find children's books, music, videos, and toys.
        Many items are 50 cents or $1, including picture books, school age fictions and nonfiction,
        non-English language books, CDs, DVDs, and books for parents and teachers.<br>
        <em>During our Saturday hours, please select no more than 12 books at a time, and bring
          them to one of our cashiers to hold until you are ready to make all your purchases.</em>
      </p>


      <h3>Bargain Room</h3>
      <p>
        Our bargain books can be found in rooms K6 and K7. The Bargain Room opens
        one hour earlier than the main room on Saturday. Hardbound books are all $1,
        paperbacks are 50 cents each, and children's books are only 25 cents. On Sunday,
        bargain room material are half-off, plus you can save even more by purchasing grocery
        bags from us for $5 each and then filling these with books.
      </p>

      <h3>Health and Safety Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        Due to our space limitations in compliance to health and safety regulations, we
        will only allow 160 patrons into the Main Room at a time.<br>
        On Satudays, patrons will be admitted in order of their numbered tickets that are given
        out from 8 to 11 am. Once inside, you may take up to 12 books off the shelves, after which
        you should purchase and then exit via the east door. Patrons may return by joining at the
        end of the remaining line at the north door and reenter in that order. The 12 book limit
        will continue past noon if a line remains outside.
      </p>
