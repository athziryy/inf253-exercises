<!--C.R.A.P principles applied:
C- contrast in colors of the background to the heading and paragraph texts.
The heading styles are distinct from the paragraphs in their size and type.
R- repetition is utilized with the pink shade being used on the borders and the
heading texts
A- alignment is used when centering heading 1, the photograph, and when the
soundtrack list was put in a blockquote.
P- proximity is used by the caption being put closer to the photo to indicate
that they are related. A margin top was applied to the photo to seperate it
slightly from the summary paragraph -->
